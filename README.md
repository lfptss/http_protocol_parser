# HTTP Protocol Parser (Coded with iRule) --*unfinished*

## Introduction

HTTP Protocol Parser is a HTTP parser implemented using BIG-IP iRule, used to simulate the basic functions of an http profile. With this set of scripts, you can achieve similar functionality without needing to mount an http profile on **Virtual Server**. 

**IMPORTANT !!!** 

This set of iRules is only for learning iRules, HTTP, TCP, and related knowledge, and must not be used in a production environment. If there is a need for HTTP protocol parsing, please use the http profile.
